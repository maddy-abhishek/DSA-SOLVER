DSA Solver 🚀

A DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) problem solver built with Autogen, powered by Groq API with LLaMA model.
The project is containerized with Docker for smooth execution and contains modular agents for solving and executing code efficiently.

📌 Features

🤖 AI-powered problem solving using LLaMA model via Groq API.

⚡ Autogen agents for:

Code Execution

Problem Solving

🛠️ Dockerized setup for consistent and portable execution.

🔧 Configurable constants, settings, and utilities for flexible workflows.

👨‍💻 Team-based agent collaboration (dsa-team).


The system will:

1.Accept DSA problems as input.

2.Use AI (LLaMA via Groq API) for problem-solving.

3.Execute solutions in a safe environment using the code executor agent.
